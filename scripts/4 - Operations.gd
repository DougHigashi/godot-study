#### Operator and Operands
#
#
# Assignment Operators =
# Is used to assign a value to a reference with the = operator
# Assigning 10 to the variable x
var x = 10
#
#
# Addition Operator +
# Assigning the adition of 10 + 10 to the variable y
var y = 10 + 10
#
#
# Subtraction Operator -
# Assigning the adition of 10 - 10 to the variable z
var z = 10 - 10
#
#
# Multiplication Operator *
# Assigning the adition of 10 * 10 to the variable xy
var xy = 10 * 10
#
#
# Division Operator /
# Assigning the adition of 10 * 10 to the variable xz
var xz = 10 * 10
#
#
# Remainder Operator %
# Assigning the remainder of the division of 10 by 10 to the variable xyz
var xyz = 10 % 10
#
#
#
#
#### Comparation Operators
#
#
# Comparison operators return a boolean value based on the expression
#
# Equals ==
#
# Greater than >
#
# Smaller than <
#
# Greater or equal >=
#
# Smaller or equal <=
#
# Different !=
#
#
#
#### Logical Operators
#
# There are three logical operators: the &&, || and !
#
### AND operator
#
# var x = true
# x && 1 
# x and 1 returns true
#
# The AND operator first checks if the leftmost value can be converted to true.
# If it can't it returns false, if not, it checks if the right operand can be converted to true...
#
var compar = true && false	# false
#
#
# 
### OR operator ||
#
# var x = false
# x || 1
# x or 1 return true
#
# The OR operator first checks if the leftmost operand can be converted to true. In this case, 
# it can't, so it checks for the right operand, and as it can be converted to true, it returns true.
#
#
# NOT operator !
#
# This operator inverts the boolean value of the expression in front of it
#
